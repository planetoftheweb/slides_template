# React Palm2

> >

You may have heard of the project called Google Bard, a new experimental product that can answer questions in a conversational way.

Behind Bard is an engine called Palm2, which has been trained on millions of parameters and is fantastic at tasks like reasoning, code, math and other languages.

In this course, we'll take a look at what it takes to create an application that uses the PaLM2 API to create your own personal chatbot. We'll use NodeJS together with React and create a simple interface to work with the Palm API to answer questions.

Althought the PaLM API is super simple, there's a lot of connectivity we'll have to take care of between a client and a server.

It's going to be a lot of fun, so let's get started.
