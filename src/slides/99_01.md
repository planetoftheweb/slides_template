I hope you enjoyed the course, you know Large Language Models like Google Bard and technologies like the PaLM API are really changing all aspects of our lives, so I hope you found this introduction useful.

If work on a project using this as a base, I'd love to know about it so post about it on linkedin and use the hashtag #poweredbylil and let us know what you think.
