# PaLM 2

Our application is going to be based on a API from Google called PaLM2, so let's talk a bit about what it is and how it works.

# Pathways Language Model

- [PaLM 2](https://ai.google/discover/palm2)
- Advanced Reasoning Tasks
- Coding
- Math
- Natural Language

> >

PaLM stands for Pathways Language Model, currently in version 2. Palm2.

Palm 2 is particularly good a certain tasks like advanced reasoning

It can code in at least 20 programming languages

It's also good at math, which other language models sometimes struggle with

It's also great natural language tasks including translation, It was trained on more than 100 spoken languages

# Uses

- [Workspace Apps](https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/generative-ai)
- [Duet](https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/duet-ai)
- [Experiments](https://labs.google.com/search/experiments)
- [MedPaLM](https://sites.research.google/med-palm), [SecPaLM](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/rsa-google-cloud-security-ai-workbench-generative-ai)

> >

Google is using the model in more than just Bard, it's being integrated into Google's own apps like Google Sheets, Docs and other workspace applications through a project called Duet ().

PaLM2 is also used to power a group of experiments called Search Labs, where Google is fold PaLM into their search products by adding results from the AI in addition to regular search results.

There are even special versions like MedPaLM that has been trained on Medical Data as well as SECPaLM which has been fine tuned on security data.

# PaLM API

- Connects your apps
- [MakerSuite](https://developers.generativeai.google/products/makersuite)

> > 


To use PaLM in your own apps, Google has created a PaLM2 API, which allows you to ask the PaLM 2 questions and receive answers. That's what we're going to work with in this course.

To use this, you're going to need to have a google account like gmail and also sign up to Googleâ€™s Makersuite, which gives you a way to create and experiment with PaLM2

Before we go on, make sure you go to the makersuite website and sign up for the waiting list. It took less than a day for me to get access, so when you have that come back to the course to continue.
